I will give a short introduction to GraphChi and its collaborative filtering toolkit.  I will also discuss shortly GraphChi-DB, my recent project that combines analytical computation with online database functionality for extremely large graphs. GraphChi [Kyrola et. al., OSDI 2012] is a disk-based system for large-scale graph computation that is able to handle graphs with billions of nodes and edges, on just a laptop or PC.  GraphChi has become a popular platform for research in recommender algorithms thanks to the comprehensive collaborative filtering toolkit developed by Danny Bickson, and its ability to solve very large problems with limited amount of RAM - thus saving practitioners hurdles of using distributed computation.

Aapo Kyrola earned his PhD from the Carnegie Mellon University in 2014, advised by prof. Carlos Guestrin and Guy Blelloch.  His thesis proposes  GraphChi and GraphChi-DB, popular software for doing large-scale graph analytics on just a laptop, based on novel algorithms for disk-based management of graphs. Prior to joining CMU, Aapo co-founded a pioneering virtual world startup Habbo Hotel (www.habbo.com) in 2000, which has attracted hundreds of millions of users and generated tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue. In 2012, he co-founded another startup that developed the automatic activity tracker app Moves. Moves was chosen by both Apple and Google as one of the best apps of 2013.  Moves was acquired by Facebook in 2014, and Aapo now works as a software engineer at its London office.

16,236,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uSIKAIJ2M,"The third means of establishing a dynamic PowerOLAP-Excel connection is OLAPPivot. The OLAPPivot setting creates, within your Excel spreadsheet, a sophisticated array of data that you are able to pivot (i.e., rearrange) data in countless ways and on which you can create sophisticated data constraints in order to customize the spreadsheet view (for example, at the least to dynamically eliminate zero rows or columns). These can be accomplished within Excel—giving Excel users many features for creating meaningful reports and analyses.  In sum, it puts advanced PowerOLAP features ""at the fingertips"" of Excel users, also enabling them to do ""on the fly"" functions to create a spreadsheet view.

OLAPPivot, like OLAPTable, shows an array of Fact Data, extending that method by dynamically building/modifying the rows and columns in Excel. OLAPPivot dynamically builds data ranges in Excel based on the user-selected PowerOLAP and Excel settings; so, for example, when a ""delete empty rows"" selection is made, later, when Cube data changes to affect that constraint, a row will be inserted to show new data.

The pivoting function, which changes the axes between rows and columns, has the same performance and speed features of OLAPTable. Because OLAPPivot presides over all rows and columns in its array—as with OLAPTable—OLAPPivot is not appropriate if you need to insert blank rows and columns into the array or use an Excel formula within a cell in the array.", ,-,-,-,-,-

Music information retrieval (MIR) is an interdisciplinary field bridging the domains of statistics, signal processing, machine learning, musicology, biology, and more. MIR algorithms allow a computer to make sense of audio data in order to bridge the semantic gap between high-level musical information — e.g. tempo, key, pitch, instrumentation, chord progression, genre, song structure — and low-level audio data. In this talk, we will survey common research problems in MIR, including music fingerprinting, transcription, classification, and recommendation, and recently proposed solutions in the research literature. The talk will contain both a high-level overview as well as concrete examples of implementing MIR algorithms in Python using the IPython notebook. We will discuss concrete elements of prototyping an MIR system including data visualization, open-source tools, and evaluation.

About Steve Tjoa
Steve Tjoa (http://stevetjoa.com) is a researcher and engineer in the areas of signal processing and machine learning for music information retrieval (MIR). He currently works on the MIR team at Humtap in San Francisco. Before that, he worked on content-based audio recognition and recommendation as an NSF-sponsored postdoctoral fellow at iZotope and Imagine Research (acquired by iZotope). He has also worked as a consultant in the areas of audio/image signal processing, machine learning, and information retrieval.

Since 2011, he has co-instructed the annual summer workshop on MIR at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University.

Description
Learn how to build recommender systems from one of Amazon’s pioneers in the field. Frank Kane spent over nine years at Amazon, where he managed and led the development of many of Amazon’s personalized product recommendation technologies.

You’ve seen automated recommendations everywhere – on Netflix’s home page, on YouTube, and on Amazon as these machine learning algorithms learn about your unique interests, and show the best products or content for you as an individual. These technologies have become central to the  largest, most prestigious tech employers out there, and by understanding how they work, you’ll become very valuable to them.


We’ll cover tried and true recommendation algorithms based on neighborhood-based collaborative filtering, and work our way up to more modern techniques including matrix factorization and even deep learning with artificial neural networks. Along the way, you’ll learn from Frank’s extensive industry experience to understand the real-world challenges you’ll encounter when applying these algorithms at large scale and with real-world data.

Recommender systems are complex; don’t enroll in this course expecting a learn-to-code type of format. There’s no recipe to follow on how to make a recommender system; you need to understand the different algorithms and how to choose when to apply each one for a given situation. We assume you already know how to code.

However, this course is very hands-on; you’ll develop your own framework for evaluating and combining many different recommendation algorithms together, and you’ll even build your own neural networks using Tensorflow to generate recommendations from real-world movie ratings from real people. We’ll cover:

Building a recommendation engine
Evaluating recommended systems
Content-based filtering using item attributes
Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering with user-based, item-based, and KNN CF
Model-based methods including matrix factorization and SVD
Applying deep learning, AI, and artificial neural networks to recommendations
Session-based recommendations with recursive neural networks
Scaling to massive data sets with Apache Spark machine learning, Amazon DSSTNE deep learning, and AWS SageMaker with factorization machines
Real-world challenges and solutions with recommender systems
Case studies from YouTube and Netflix
Building hybrid, ensemble recommenders
This comprehensive course takes you all the way from the early days of collaborative filtering, to bleeding-edge applications of deep neural networks and modern machine learning techniques for recommending the best items to every individual user.

The coding exercises in this course use the Python programming language. We include an intro to Python if you’re new to it, but you’ll need some prior programming experience in order to use this course successfully. We also include a short introduction to deep learning if you are new to the field of artificial intelligence, but you’ll need to be able to understand new computer algorithms.

High-quality, hand-edited English closed captions are included to help you follow along.


I hope to see you in the course soon!

Music Information Retrieval (MIR), as an interdisciplinary area of research, has developed rapidly in the last decades. MIR research has been historically focusing on Western music and context, with few studies on issues and challenges related to non-Western music or users with a non-Western cultural background. In this talk, Dr Hu will present a series of studies on cross-cultural music mood recognition, including comparisons of mood perceptions between listeners from different cultural backgrounds, and cross-cultural generalizability of automatic music mood recognition models. She also talks about user-centered evaluation on complete MIR systems. - See more at: http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/events/cross-cultural-music-mood-recognition", ,Person,Xiao Hu,Xiao Hu,Person,TP
