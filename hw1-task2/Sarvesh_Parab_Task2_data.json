In the real world, data comes split across many data sets, but dplyr's core functions are designed to work with single tables of data. In this course, you'll learn the best ways to combine data sets into single tables. You'll learn how to augment columns from one data set with columns from another with mutating joins, how to filter one data set against another with filtering joins, and how to sift through data sets with set operations. Along the way, you'll discover the best practices for building data sets and troubleshooting joins with dplyr. Afterwards, you\u2019ll be well on your way to data manipulation mastery!",

The art of function writing is what you'll learn in this first Python Data Science toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice.

It is important to be able to extract, filter, and transform data from DataFrames in order to drill into the data that really matters. The pandas library has many techniques that make this process efficient and intuitive. You will learn how to tidy, rearrange, and restructure your data by pivoting or melting and stacking or unstacking DataFrames. These are all fundamental next steps on the road to becoming a well-rounded Data Scientist, and you will have the chance to apply all the concepts you learn to real-world datasets.",

Why value bonds?Bonds are securities issued by governments or corporations that pay interest over a fixed schedule and are the most well-known type of fixed income securities. The US fixed income market is 1.5x larger than the US stock market, but, unlike stocks, most fixed income instruments, including bonds, trade very infrequently. Consequently, a bond's price may be a less reliable indicator of its value and analytical techniques are necessary when analyzing and valuing bonds.",

        "description": "One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference, or the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data. Although counter intuitive, the standard practice is to attempt to disprove a research claim that is not of interest. For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).",

Machine Learning is the field of teaching machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data - will a given tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam or not? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of Machine Learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, how to tune their parameters and how to tell how well they will perform on unseen data, all the while using real world datasets. You'll do so using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.",

        "description": "Say you have a collection of customers with a variety of characteristics such as age, location, and financial history, and you wish to discover patterns and sort them into clusters. Or perhaps you have a set of texts, such as wikipedia pages, and you wish to segment them into categories based on their content. This is the world of unsupervised learning, called as such because you are not guiding, or supervising, the pattern discovery by some prediction task, but instead uncovering hidden structure from unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and scipy. You will learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists.",

Combining the basics of cash flow valuation with the calculation of survival and death probabilities in R will allow you to construct insightful tools to design life insurance products. You'll come out of this course understanding the valuation of life contingent claims: life annuities, which provide an income upon survival, and life insurance products, which pay a benefit upon death of the policyholder.",

        "description": "Forecasting involves making predictions about the future. It is required in many situations: deciding whether to build another power generation plant in the next ten years requires forecasts of future demand; scheduling staff in a call centre next week requires forecasts of call volumes; stocking an inventory requires forecasts of stock requirements. Forecasts can be required several years in advance (for the case of capital investments), or only a few minutes beforehand (for telecommunication routing). Whatever the circumstances or time horizons involved, forecasting is an important aid to effective and efficient planning. This course provides an introduction to time series forecasting using R. ",

For those occasions where APIs are not available, you'll find out how to use R to scrape information out of web pages. In the process you'll learn how to get data out of even the most stubborn website, and how to turn it into a format ready for further analysis.

The first step in the model building process is to collect data on the underlying risk factors that affect portfolio value and analyze their behavior. In this course, you will learn how to work with risk-factor return series, study the empirical properties or so-called \"stylized facts\" of these data - including their typical non-normality and volatility, and make estimates of value-at-risk for a portfolio.",

Location is an important explanatory variable in so many things - be it a disease outbreak, an animal's choice of habitat, a traffic collision, or a vein of gold in the mountains - that we would be wise to include it whenever possible. This course will start you on your journey of spatial data analysis. You'll learn what classes of statistical problems present themselves with spatial data, and the basic techniques of how to deal with them.

This course gives you a chance to think about how different samples can produce different linear models, where your goal is to understand the underlying population model.  From the estimated linear model, you will learn how to create interval estimates for the effect size as well as how to determine if the effect is significant.  Prediction intervals for the response variable will be contrasted with estimates of the average response. Throughout the course, you'll gain more practice with the dplyr and ggplot2 packages, and you will learn about the broom package for tidying models; all three packages are invaluable in data science.",

This course will introduce you to time series analysis in Python. After learning about what a time series is, you'll learn about several time series models ranging from autoregressive and moving average models to cointegration models. Along the way, you'll learn how to estimate, forecast, and simulate these models using statistical libraries in Python. You'll see numerous examples of how these models are used, with a particular emphasis on applications in finance.",

For many data scientists, the largest limitation of Python is that all data must fit into the resident memory of the available workstation. Further, traditionally, Python has only been able to utilize one CPU. Data scientists constantly ask, \"How can I read and process large amounts of data?\" and \"How can I make use of more computational processing resources?\" This course will introduce you to Dask, a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing. With Dask, you will be able to take the Python workflows you currently have and easily scale them up to large datasets on your workstation without the need to migrate to a distributed computing environment.\n",

        "description": "There has never been a better time to use R for spatial analysis! The brand new sf package has made working with vector data in R a breeze and the raster package provides a set of powerful and intuitive tools to work gridded data like satellite imagery. Instead of the painful process of performing your spatial analysis in GIS systems like ArcGIS or QGIS and then shuffling your results into another system for analysis you can move your entire spatial analysis workflow into R. In this course you will learn why the sf package is rapidly taking over spatial analysis in R. You will read in spatial data, manipulate vectors using the dplyr package and learn how to work with coordinate reference systems. You'll also learn how to perform geoprocessing of vectors including buffering, spatial joins, computing intersections, simplifying and measuring distance. With rasters you will aggregate, reclassify, crop, mask and extract. The last chapter of the course is devoted to showing you how to make maps in R with the ggplot2 and tmap packages and performing a fun mini-analysis that brings together all your new skills.",

        "description": "This is an introduction to the programming language R, focused on a powerful set of tools known as the \"tidyverse\". In the course you'll learn the intertwined processes of data manipulation and visualization through the tools dplyr and ggplot2. You'll learn to manipulate data by filtering, sorting and summarizing a real dataset of historical country data in order to answer exploratory questions. You'll then learn to turn this processed data into informative line plots, bar plots, histograms, and more with the ggplot2 package. This gives a taste both of the value of exploratory data analysis and the power of tidyverse tools. This is a suitable introduction for people who have no previous experience in R and are interested in learning to perform data analysis.",

Regardless of the background, there will be times when a particular algorithm is implemented in one language and not the other, a feature is better documented, or simply, the tutorial you found online uses Python instead of R.\n\nIn either case, this would require the R user to work in Python to get his/her work done, or try to understand how something is implemented in Python for it to be translated into R.

You'll learn what a random effect is and how to use one to model your data. Next, the course covers linear mixed-effect regressions. These powerful models will allow you to explore data with a more complicated structure than a standard linear regression. The course then teaches generalized linear mixed-effect regressions. Generalized linear mixed-effects models allow you to model more kinds of data, including binary responses and count data. Lastly, the course goes over repeated-measures analysis as a special case of mixed-effect modeling. This kind of data appears when subjects are followed over time and measurements are collected at intervals. Throughout the course you'll work with real data to answer interesting questions using mixed-effects models.",

Tree models present a high flexibility that comes at a price: on one hand, trees are able to capture complex non-linear relationships; on the other hand, they are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset. By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. Ensemble methods are used across a variety of fields and have a proven track record of winning many machine learning competitions.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to use Python to train decision trees and tree-based models with the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library. You'll understand the advantages and shortcomings of trees and demonstrate how ensembling can alleviate these shortcomings, all while practicing on real-world datasets. Finally, you'll also understand how to tune the most influential hyperparameters in order to get the most out of your models.",

More flexible than linear models, and more understandable than black-box methods, GAMs model relationships in data as nonlinear functions that are highly adaptable to different types of data and data science problems.  In this course, you'll learn how GAMs work and how to construct them with the popular mgcv package.  You'll learn how to interpret, explain and visualize your model results, and how to diagnose and fix model problems. You'll work with data sets that will show you how to apply GAMs to a variety of situations: automobile performance data for building mixed linear and nonlinear models, soil pollution data for building geospatial models, and consumer purchasing data for classification and prediction. By the end of this course, you'll have a toolbox for solving many data science problems.",

The popularity of such Bayesian models has grown along with the availability of computing resources required for their implementation. You will utilize one of these resources - the rjags package in R. Combining the power of R with the JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) engine, rjags provides a framework for Bayesian modeling, inference, and prediction.",

You'll learn how to standardize your data so that it's in the right form for your model, create new features to best leverage the information in your dataset, and select the best features to improve your model fit. Finally, you'll have some practice preprocessing by getting a dataset on UFO sightings ready for modeling.",

Mixture models use familiar probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial) to provide a convenient yet formal statistical framework for clustering and classification. Unlike standard clustering approaches, we can estimate the probability of belonging to a cluster and make inference about the sub-populations. For example, in the context of marketing, you may want to cluster different customer groups and find their respective probabilities of purchasing specific products to better target them with custom promotions. When applying natural language processing to a large set of documents, you may want to cluster documents into different topics and understand how important each topic is across each document. In this course, you will learn what Mixture Models are, how they are estimated, and when it is appropriate to apply them!",

As high-throughput sequencing becomes more affordable and accessible to a wider community of researchers, the knowledge to analyze this data is becoming an increasingly valuable skill. Join us in learning about the RNA-Seq workflow and discovering how to identify which genes and biological processes may be important for your condition of interest! We will start the course with a brief overview of the RNA-Seq workflow with an emphasis on differential expression (DE) analysis. Starting with the counts for each gene, the course will cover how to prepare data for DE analysis, assess the quality of the count data, and identify outliers and detect major sources of variation in the data. The DESeq2 R package will be used to model the count data using a negative binomial model and test for differentially expressed genes. Visualization of the results with heatmaps and volcano plots will be performed and the significant differentially expressed genes will be identified and saved.",

The aim of network analytics is to predict to which class a network node belongs, such as churner or not, fraudster or not, defaulter or not, etc.  To accomplish this, we discuss how to leverage information from the network and its underlying structure in a predictive way.  More specifically, we introduce the idea of featurization such that network features can be added to non-network features as such boosting the performance of any resulting analytical model.  In this course, you will use the igraph package to generate and label a network of customers in a churn setting and learn about the foundations of network learning. Then, you will learn about homophily, dyadicity and heterophilicty, and how these can be used to get key exploratory insights in your network. Next, you will use the functionality of the igraph package to compute various network features to calculate both node-centric as well as neighbor based network features.  Furthermore, you will use the Google PageRank algorithm to compute network features and empirically validate their predictive power. Finally, we teach you how to generate a flat dataset from the network and analyze it using logistic regression and random forests.",

A generalized linear model (GLM) expands upon linear regression to include non-normal distributions including binomial and count data. Throughout this course, you will expand your data science toolkit to include GLMs in R. As part of learning about GLMs, you will learn how to fit model binomial data with logistic regression and count data with Poisson regression. You will also learn how to understand these results and plot them with ggplot2.",

Fraud attempts are expected to even increase further in future, making fraud detection highly necessary in most industries. This course will show how learning fraud patterns from historical data can be used to fight fraud. Some techniques from robust statistics and digit analysis are presented to detect unusual observations that are likely associated with fraud. Two main challenges when building a supervised tool for fraud detection are the imbalance or skewness of the data and the various costs for different types of misclassification. We present techniques to solve these issues and focus on artificial and real datasets from a wide variety of fraud applications.",

Whether it is a brain cell helping you to read this web page or an immune cell patrolling your body for microorganisms that would make you sick, they all carry the same genome. What differentiates them are the genes that are active at any given time. Which genes these are is determined by a complex system of proteins that can activate and deactivate genes. When this regulatory machinery gets out of control, it can lead to cancer and other debilitating diseases. ChIP-seq analysis allows us to understand the function of regulatory proteins, how they can contribute to disease and can provide insights into how we may be able to intervene to prevent cells from spinning out of control. In this course, you will explore a real dataset while learning how to process and analyze ChIP-seq data in R.",
